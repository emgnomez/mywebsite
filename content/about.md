	<h1>tl;dr</h1>
	<p>
		My name is Emily Gomez and I'm pursuing my second Bachelor's in Graphic Design at SNHU. I graduated a few years ago with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and minored in Math and Studio Art. I've worked full-time as a software engineer for the past two years and am looking to find more purpose in my next position, where I can use creative vision and create friendly user interfaces.

	<h1>Full Story</h1>
	<p>
        Welcome to the about page! My name is Emily Gomez, and Nebraska is my home state. Growing up, I've always loved drawing and art classes. In junior high, my art teacher told me that graphic design would be my calling. In high school, three career paths intrigued me -  graphic design, computer science, and foreign language translation. At the end of my first year in college, I committed to pursuing Computer Science. Many of my family members were in the tech field, and the idea of user experience combined with frontend web interfaces interested me.

		There was still a creative side to me that Computer Science classes didn't satisfy, so during university, I minored in Studio Art, having my first experience with graphic design. My teachers inspired me so much, and it felt like a landmark discovery in my life. Thank you to Professor Strube and Professor Severson!

		During university, I had the chance to embark on two study-abroad adventures meeting some wonderful people, including my partner. I spent two weeks in Japan at the Chiba University of Commerce and six months in the Netherlands at TU Delft. I discovered so much about other places, cultures, and people, and these experiences helped shape who I am today.

		I worked as a software engineer for two years after graduation and recently moved to Seattle, WA. My company couldn't sustain remote work from there, so I took the time to think about what I wanted in my next job. Working to create user-friendly frontend interfaces is my passion, but I also wanted to understand the question - <b><i>what makes a good web design?</i></b>
	<p>
		Everything has come full circle, and I'm now pursuing higher education in Graphic Design to understand the design of user interfaces. I'm excited about the opportunities to utilize my design knowledge and what it takes to create user-friendly frontend web designs.

		A little more about me is that I love anime, webtoons, traveling, cooking, sustainability, my plants, and learning new things. I play sudoku or video games, visit Frankie & Jo's ice cream every other week, make videos of recent adventures, and work on personal art projects in my spare time.
