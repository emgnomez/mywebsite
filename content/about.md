        Welcome to the about page! My name is Emily Gomez and I'm originally born and raised in Omaha/Lincoln, NE. Growing up I was always drawing and loved taking art classes. In college I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science because my mother and stepfather worked at CSG and that seemed like a great career.

		During college I decided to minor in Studio Art and had my first taste of graphic design.
		Those classes left an impression on me to this day. Thank you Professor Strube and Professor Severson!
	</p>

		I also had a chance to embark on two study abroad adventures where I met some very wonderful people including my partner. I spent two weeks in Japan at CUC and six months in the Netherlands at TU Delft. These experiences helped shape who I am today and I am grateful for them.
	</p>
	<p>
		At present, I've left my job as a software engineer and am now pursuing higher education in graphic design. The desire to learn design is what I'm currently moving towards and I am now looking forward to opportunities where I can learn to create user friendly frontend web designs.

		A little more about me is that I love anime, webtoons, travelling (heh), cooking, my plants, bunnies, and learning new things. I've recently picked up sudoku, am reading Slaughterhouse Five, and will eventually beat Zelda BOTW when I gain the courage to finish it. I also have a really cool big brother.
