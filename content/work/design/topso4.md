# TopSo Website

## Background
At the end of Graphic Design II, I worked on a team of four students to create a brand identity for a mining restoration company located in Zambia. We created the company known as TopSo which is short for top soil as our company's mission was the restoration of mines in Zambia - using new soil to recover the land to what it was.

Located throughout design are other pieces of TopSo that I helped create for the brand.
