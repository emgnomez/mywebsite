# TopSo Website

## Background
At the end of Graphic Design II, I worked on a team of four students to create a brand identity for a mining restoration company located in Zambia. We created the company known as TopSo which is short for top soil as our company's mission was the restoration of mines in Zambia - using new soil to recover the land to what it was.

Located throughout design are other pieces of TopSo that I helped create for the brand.

## This Design

I created a mock website for TopSo using InVision. The home page has an introduction and call-to-action video underneath. The about page has the TopSo's history, mission, message, values, and leadereship. We have pages going over the mining reclamation process, the projects who we've partnered with, and a petition to require mining companies to take responsibility over abandoned mines.
