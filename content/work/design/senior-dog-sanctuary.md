# Senior Dog Sanctuary Poster

## Background
I created a call-to-action poster for a Senior Dog Sancutuary in my Fundamentals of Design class. I utilized Illustrator and used images from Pexels. The purpose was to increase visibiliity within the local community.

## This Design
I used a large image of a dog at the bottom to catch the attention of viewers. The dog's eyes are gazing upwards and there is a path to follow on the left of the poster up to the heading. Both the dog and heading text tell you the most important information about this poster - dogs and sanctuary. The background yellow was meant to draw attention with the brightness and the heading text has a sharp and captive typeface. All elements are aligned. Contrasting is happening with thick and thin lines. Repetition is present in the length of sentences and space between sections. The dog pawprints image is meant to help create the negative space above the dog's eye and to help create movement in the piece.
