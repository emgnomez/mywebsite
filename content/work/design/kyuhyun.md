# Kyuhyun Poster

## Background
I created a poster for my favorite artist, Cho Kyuhyun, during a Digital Media class. I utilized Illustrator.

## This Design
The design is inspired from Kyuhyun's first mini-album, At Gwanghwangum, which the album has an autumn theme and somber feeling to it. I utilized a cool color palette to express sadness and lonelineness. I created a silhouette of Kyuhyun in the lower middle half surrounded by trees. The leaves are lesser due to the autumn season. I added leaves blowing up towards his name and stylized the typeface I used. Below his name is where the concert would be held and the date I created the poster.

*I did a touch up of this poster in 2022 removing some elements and adding in the loose leaves at the top*
