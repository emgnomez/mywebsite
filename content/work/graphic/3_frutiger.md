# Frutiger
- InDesign
  
I chose Frutiger as my final project's typeface in Typography class and completed a "Homage to Typeface" assignment.

I utilized a four-column grid, aligning sections of information within it and creating elements of visual interest. With Frutiger's creation intended for airports, I gave this layout design a few airport elements. I included text made out of varying Frutiger font styles in the shape of a plane and its path. I also added common words seen on signs at the airport. This layout has a lot of movement and utilizes certain design elements such as negative space, contrast, emphasis, and various font styles to showcase the Frutiger type family.
