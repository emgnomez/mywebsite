# Wood-Block Printing Magazine Spread
- InDesign

I created a two-page magazine spread from text with text and a graphic given in my Typography class. I layered many elements on page one into a wood-block print by Hokusai (my favorite art piece - the Great Wave of Kanagawa!). I bolded certain beginning sentences I thought provoked interest and statements that would keep the audience's attention. I gave a slightly textured background to page two to make the layout more interesting and connect to the image on page one.
