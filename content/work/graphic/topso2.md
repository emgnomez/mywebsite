# TopSo Top Version Logo

## Background
At the end of Graphic Design II, I worked on a team of four students to create a brand identity for a mining restoration company located in Zambia. We created the company known as TopSo which is short for top soil as our company's mission was the restoration of mines in Zambia - using new soil to recover the land to what it was.

Located throughout design are other pieces of TopSo that I helped create for the brand.

## Design

This TopSo logo design is positioned with the leaf on top of the company name and is on a black/white background.

The colors in the leaf of the logo have an orange/brown, green, and white. The leaf shows the process of restoring the land by planting new life over the old soiled mines and the air above aiding in this restoration process.
