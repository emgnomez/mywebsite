# Focus 05 Advertisement

## Background
In my Design Thinking course, I completed a process book where I conducted research on the target audience (millennials) and came up with a final design that was intended to be displayed in the advertisements pf a subway car.

I created a mood board and mind map for this process book and the image above is one of the final mockups I came up with.

## Design
### The Problem
The previous subway design had brought in more boomers than millennials.

### Solution
This design focuses on contemporary stylistic elements to attract the millennial audience. San-serif typefaces were used as well as colors that promote the earth and sustainable ingredients. The colors are bright and positive. The image displayed has younger people gathered in groups surrounded by technology.
