# Focus 05 Advertisement
- Illustrator

In my Design Thinking course, I completed a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/j61v43zxqlqqxsf/2022.12.7_GRA%20280%20Project%20Process%20Book%20-%20Gomez.pdf?dl=0" style="color: var(--main);" onmouseover="this.style.color='var(--dark)'" onmouseout="this.style.color='var(--main)'">process book</a> where I conducted research on the target audience (millennials) and came up with a final design that was intended to be displayed in the advertisements of a subway car.

I created a mood board and mind map for this process book and the image above is one of the final mockups I came up with. Image is taken from Unsplash.

### Problem
The previous Focus 05 advertisement had brought in more boomers than millennials to the restaurant.

### Solution
This design focuses on contemporary stylistic elements to attract the millennial audience. San-serif typefaces were used as well as colors that promote the earth and sustainable ingredients. The colors are bright and positive. The image displayed has younger people socializing and surrounded by technology.
