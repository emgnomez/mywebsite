# TopSo Side Version Logo

## Background
At the end of Graphic Design II, I worked on a team of four students to create a brand identity for a mining restoration company located in Zambia. We created the company known as TopSo which is short for top soil as our company's mission was the restoration of mines in Zambia - using new soil to recover the land to what it was.

Located throughout are other pieces of TopSo that I helped create for my team's company.

## Design

The TopSo logo is positioned to the left of the text and it on a black/white background.

The colors in the leaf of the logo have an orange/brown, green, and white. The leaf shows the process of restoring the land by planting new life over the old soiled mines and the air above aiding in this restoration process.
