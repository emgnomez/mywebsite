# Kyuhyun Poster
- Illustrator

I created a poster for my favorite artist, Cho Kyuhyun, during a Digital Media class.

The design is inspired by Kyuhyun's first mini-album, At Gwanghwangum. The album has an autumn and somber theme. I utilized a cool color palette to express sadness and loneliness. A silhouette of Kyuhyun is in the lower middle half surrounded by trees. The leaves are lesser due to the autumn season. I added leaves blowing up toward his name and stylized the typeface.

*I did a touch-up of this poster in 2022, removing some elements and adding in the loose leaves at the top*
