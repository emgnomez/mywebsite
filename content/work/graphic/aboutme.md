# About Me

## Background
I created an about me poster as my introduction to the class in Graphic Design II. At the time I was traveling to a lot of new places and felt it to be an integral part of myself to share. I placed an image of every country flag I had visited to that point.

## Design
I aligned the tops and bottoms to the other flags both vertically and horizontally. The airplane image has close proximity and is pointing to my name which draws your eye to it. Looking back at this design now, it looks very red and the repeated background design may be a bit too strong for my liking. -->
