# No Thank You
- InDesign
- Photoshop

I created this poster at the end of my first Graphic Design course on a topic I felt strongly about - in this case single-use plastic bags.

For this piece I did a color pencil drawing of a hand holding a plastic bag. I scanned it into my laptop and used Photoshop and Illustrator to edit it.

I utilized the common phrase, "THANK YOU", you often see on plastic bags and changed it to "NO THANK YOU" to remind whoever sees this that there is always the option to refuse a plastic bag if you don't actually need it. -->
