# Senior Dog Sanctuary Poster
- Illustrator

I created a call-to-action poster for a Senior Dog Sanctuary in my Fundamentals of Design class. Images are taken from Pexels. 

## Problem
The purpose was to increase visibility within the local community of the senior dog sanctuary.

## Solution
I used a large image of a dog at the bottom to draw attention to the poster. The dog's eyes are gazing upwards, and there is a path to follow on the left side up to the heading. The dog and heading text tell you the most important information about this poster - dogs and sanctuary. The background yellow is eye-catching, and the heading text has a sharp and captive typeface. All elements are aligned. Contrasting is happening with thick and thin lines. Repetition is present in the length of sentences and space between sections. The dog paw-prints image helps create the negative space above the dog's eye and to help create movement in the piece. -->
