# Global Clean Water Initiative Poster
- Illustrator
- Photoshop

In my Professional Practices course, I completed a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zh3jujs6ay3ryfx/2022.12.8-GRA%20290%20Project%20Two%20Gomez.pdf?dl=0" style="color: var(--main);" onmouseover="this.style.color='var(--dark)'" onmouseout="this.style.color='var(--main)'">design brief and project proposal</a> where I learned about project scheduling, identifying the target audience, and understanding why my design works.  Images are taken from Unsplash and Pexels.

## Problem
The goal of this project is to find volunteers in the local community of Mexico for the Global Clean Water Initiative which builds sustainable solutions for clean water in the community.

## Solution
This design focuses on traditional elements such as using serif typefaces and showing a family. It uses a color palette of red, green, and blue. Red and green are colors in the Mexican flag and the blue symbolizes the clear skies and water of Mexico. -->
