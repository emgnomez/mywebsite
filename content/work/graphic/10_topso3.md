# TopSo Seed Bag Product
- Photoshop

At the end of Graphic Design II, I worked on a team of four students to create a brand identity for a mining restoration company located in Zambia. We created the company known as TopSo which is short for top soil as our company's mission was the restoration of mines in Zambia - using new soil to recover the land to what it was.

I created a Flower Seed Bag and Plant Seed Bag product designs to sell under the TopSo company. With the purpose of the company being restorative and sustaining the earth, a product which promotes growing new life from the land was decided on. I utilized a bag package design template and edited both in Photoshop. All of the elements utilize the brand identity of TopSo.
