# TOWN Website
- AdobeXD

I created a website for a mock restaurant called TOWN. Images are taken from Unsplash. Mockup image is by d3images on Freepik.

Here is the final website result: <a target="_blank" href="https://town-restaurant-nyc.netlify.app/" style="color: var(--pink);" onmouseover="this.style.color='var(--dark)'" onmouseout="this.style.color='var(--pink)'">town-restaurant-nyc.netlify.app</a>

# Process

I was given an asset list and brand style guidelines to follow. Once I understood the requirements, I created some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ixo9y85d2jlttas/2023.1.23_GRA_310_Wireframes_Gomez.pdf?dl=0" style="color: var(--pink);" onmouseover="this.style.color='var(--dark)'" onmouseout="this.style.color='var(--pink)'"> wireframes</a> to give me inspiration for how the landing page would look. Then I implemented the mockup into HTML/CSS.
