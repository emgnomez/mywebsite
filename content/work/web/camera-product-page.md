# Camera Product Page Mockup
- AdobeXD

I created a camera product page mockup from a prompt I was given on an application. Images are taken from Unsplash.

I made the camera image large and included the ratings and other camera images around to emphasis it. The rating is the second thing you may see when looking at this page which will encourage the shopper to buy it more if seen right at the beginning. There are more images below the large image for the viewer to analyze how good the product looks.

Once done with the face value, the shopper's eyes will rest to the left of the page at the title and the price. Their eyes would read the rest of the information naturally flowing downwards. This design is readable, there is an element of interest to the left of a rounded object which is meant to represent a camera's lense, and each element is aligned to make a cohesive design.

I also created the camera logo to the top left of the page with three shapes. The design is simple and effective in communicating what this site is about.
