# Goodly Cookies Website Redesign
- Adobe XD
- Adobe Illustrator

I created a website redesign for the Goodly Cookies website. Mockup image is by Vectonauta on Freepik.

Read my in depth analysis of the Goodly Cookies website in my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/u0rut9apcjy5381/Final%20Project%20-%20Goodly%20Cookies%20Website%20Case%20Study%20-%20Gomez.pdf?dl=0" style="color: var(--main);" onmouseover="this.style.color='var(--dark)'" onmouseout="this.style.color='var(--main)'">case study</a>.

## Process

I started by conducting user research. From it I drafted three personas and scenarios. Next, I crafted low fidelity prototypes by hand and then created a high fidelity prototype across the three UI platforms - Web, Tablet, and Mobile.
