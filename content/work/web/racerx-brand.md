# RacerX Brand Style Guidelines
- Adobe Illustrator
- Adobe InDesign
- Brand Identity

# Purpose
The purpose of this design artifact is to show that I understand how to create <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/6o6amd92vvdj9gt/2023.6.27_Brand%20Guidelines%20-%20RacerX.pdf?dl=0" style="color: var(--pink);" onmouseover="this.style.color='var(--dark)'" onmouseout="this.style.color='var(--pink)'">Brand Identity Guidelines</a>. The audience of this design artifact is people interested in my branding experience. Real-world users are workers at RacerX who create brand content. This artifact needs to show I created a unique brand concept for RacerX. I used a magazine mockup and showed various pages of the logo guide. The brand guidelines communicate the company’s personality, mission, tone of voice, and usage guidelines for all visual elements, such as logos, imagery, and patterns.

# Design Rationale
The overall concept for this design artifact is a gaming company’s brand identity guidelines. The company’s designers and employees will look to it when making design decisions such as website design, magazine advertising, or business cards. This design meets my audiences’ needs by communicating RacerX’s brand identity. The mockup shows that this design is meant to be viewed physically and flipped through. I used the principles/elements of contrast and repetition. The contrast is shown through colors (red vs blue), typography (fun vs formal), and scale of the elements. Repetition is achieved through the consistent spacing between headers/content, imagery, pattern placement, and layout.

# Design Abilities
Some unique aspects of this design artifact are the unique cover and each section has an eye-catching cover. This design artifact shows that I am aware of what goes into brand identity, how to research competitors, and what sections are necessary to consider for the guidelines.

# Potential Improvements
An improvement to these guidelines would be either making a digital version or updating the current to reflect a standard magazine size/layout. The current working document is not on facing pages, so there needs to be more consideration for items placed near the gutter. The paging should also be updated as it doesn't fit a magazine format. These updates will make my design better when viewed in a magazine. Considering a digital layout will make this a better viewing experience on the web too.
