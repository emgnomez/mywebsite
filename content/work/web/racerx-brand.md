# RacerX Brand Style Guidelines
- Adobe Illustrator
- Adobe InDesign

I created brand style guidelines for a gaming company called RacerX. Images are taken from Unsplash and Pexels. Mockup image is from qeaql-studio on Freepik.

I conducted target audience research, logo sketches, final logo renditions, and brand style guide components.
