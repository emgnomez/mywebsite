# TOWN Website Wireframe
- AdobeXD

I created a website wireframe for the homepage of a mock restaurant called TOWN. Images are taken from Unsplash.

Here is the final website result: <a target="_blank" href="https://town-restaurant-nyc.netlify.app/" style="color: var(--main);" onmouseover="this.style.color='var(--dark)'" onmouseout="this.style.color='var(--main)'">town-restaurant-nyc.netlify.app</a>
