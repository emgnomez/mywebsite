# Purpose
The purpose of this design artifact is to show that I am capable of doing a website redesign showcasing my capabilities in <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/9e8ec803-e229-4256-a583-e607fb760bb2-cbdd/screen/2298fdf1-a1d7-4740-a306-e502e88c60f0?fullscreen" style="color: var(--pink);" onmouseover="this.style.color='var(--dark)'" onmouseout="this.style.color='var(--pink)'">High Fidelity Prototyping</a>. The audience of this design artifact is people interested in my website design capabilities and processes. Real-world users are people interested in finding new brands that align with their values. This artifact needs to show I created an efficient redesign of the <a href="https://fairearth.eco" style="color: var(--pink);" onmouseover="this.style.color='var(--dark)'" onmouseout="this.style.color='var(--pink)'">Fairearth</a> website across web and mobile platforms. I used a mockup only containing the web mockup as I haven’t finished the mobile one yet. The mockup communicates how the redesigned Fairearth website looks across the web platform.

# Design Rationale
The overall concept for this design artifact is a redesign of a company’s website. This redesign meets consumers’ needs by including the main purpose of the website on the landing page – filtering and looking through potential brands to buy from. I also included a redesign of the brand profile page (as seen by clicking COS) which is the second most important part of the website. The redesign meets potential client’s needs by showing I can redesign a website and focus on the primary functionality that must be performed. I also regularly considered a consumer’s perspective whilst designing. I used the principles/elements of repetition, harmony, and hierarchy. Repetition and harmony are achieved by showing a consistent layout of elements through the brand pages on the landing, profile pages, and using a consistent color scheme across all pages. This unifies the company’s brand identity. The top of each page has a header image that engages the user visually with plant and clothing imagery.

# Design Abilities
A unique aspect of this design artifact is the interactive <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/b42c6ae1-8780-4d9d-bf48-603de714e8d7-e17f/screen/2298fdf1-a1d7-4740-a306-e502e88c60f0?fullscreen" style="color: var(--pink);" onmouseover="this.style.color='var(--dark)'" onmouseout="this.style.color='var(--pink)'">High Fidelity Prototype</a> I created to accompany it. This design artifact shows that I can create a new look for a website that otherwise had no design elements before. In the interactive prototype, I have separate artboards to show the main components and design elements that I used. Lastly, it shows my skills in using Adobe XD and prototyping capabilities.

# Potential Improvements
An improvement to this website redesign would be to create the Blog page/posts and create the mobile redesign (which I’m working on now). Another improvement is adding the functionality to select from the dropdown menu and remove the filtering options within the prototype. I could also update all the filtering options from the drop-down menu to its respective name instead of repeating the component text. It is tedious work but will make the prototype come even more to life.
