# Fairearth Logo
- Illustrator
- Logo Design

# Purpose
The purpose of this design artifact is to promote <a href="https://fairearth.eco" style="color: var(--pink);" onmouseover="this.style.color='var(--dark)'" onmouseout="this.style.color='var(--pink)'">fairearth</a> through a logo that aligns with its values.

# Process

I started by doing in depth research into their company values, mission, and goals. I created a moodboard and went over it with the client.

Once the intention behind the company was understood, I starting doing sketches of the logo. From those sketched I picked an idea that stood out the most and scanned it into Ilustrator. I showed three iterations of the design to the client and we worked through it making sure the end result was how the client envisioned.
