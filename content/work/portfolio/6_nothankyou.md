# Purpose
The purpose of this design artifact is to show my ability in making call-to-action posters. The audience of this design artifact is people interested in my technical skills and graphic design capabilities. The real-world users are consumers and conscious fashion brands. The consumers are people interested in sustainability and declining the use of single-use plastic bags. This artifact should show how my design fits in a printed and public setting. It also should show scalability for being a poster in the city.

# Design Rationale
The overall concept for this design artifact is to promote a call-to-action to limit single-use plastic bags. This design meets my audiences’ needs by communicating the action of refusing plastic bags with a simple “no thank you”. This plays off the common phrase seen of “thank you” on the bags. The mockup shows that the design should be viewed in public areas. Preferably near grocery stores where the usage is common. I used the principles/elements of color, balance, and repetition in this design. The bright red of the wordage jumps out to a passerby grabbing their attention immediately. The hand at the top balances out the bag and message at the bottom. Lastly, repeating the words “Thank You” creates a nostalgic feeling within someone. This poster uses that feeling and uses the repeating phrase “No Thank You” to leave a different message instead.

# Design Abilities
Unique aspects of this design artifact is the mix between a hand drawing and digital graphic elements. I scanned in a colored pencil drawing of a hand holding a plastic bag. Then I layered graphic elements on top in Photoshop. This design artifact shows my creative side and ability to incorporate a mix of different techniques to create a design.

# Potential Improvements
An improvement to this call-to-action poster is revisiting the textual elements’ placement and use. There could be more integration between the text and drawing image such as adding shadowing to make the text feel more a part of the image. I would also reconsider the coloring of the “We Say No” text. There is no other instance of black and I think that black breaks the cohesion of the design slightly. I’d also reconsider the blue and background behind the hand and bag graphic. There is a potential to make a better design promoting the refusal of single-us plastic bags through revisiting of fundamental design elements.
