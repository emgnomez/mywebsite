# Wood-Block Printing Magazine Spread
- InDesign
- Magazine Layout

# Purpose
I created a two-page magazine layout for a wood-block printing article.

<img src="/wave1.png" style="height:1em;margin-left:0">

# Process
I layered many elements on page one over a wood-block print by Hokusai (my favorite art piece - the Great Wave of Kanagawa!). I bolded certain beginning sentences I thought provoked interest and statements that would keep the audience's attention. I gave a slightly textured background to page two to make the layout more interesting and cohesive with the image on page one.
