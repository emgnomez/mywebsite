# Purpose
The purpose of this design artifact is to show the final website design I created at <a target="_blank" href="https://town-restaurant-nyc.netlify.app/" style="color: var(--pink);" onmouseover="this.style.color='var(--dark)'" onmouseout="this.style.color='var(--pink)'">town-restaurant-nyc.netlify.app</a>. The audience of this design artifact is people interested in my web design and programming experience. The real-world users are people interested in eating fine dining in Manhattan. This artifact should show how my design fits on a monitor and give a sense of the website’s layout, hierarchy, and style. The website should communicate the restaurant’s personality, mission, menu, and history, reaching out to more potential customers. It can also be a place where users make an online reservation.

# Design Rationale
The overall concept for this design artifact is a high-end restaurant’s website design. This design meets my audiences’ needs by communicating TOWN’s goals of making reservations and seeing the menu. The mockup shows that the design should be viewed on the computer. I used the principles/elements of hierarchy, movement, and negative space. Hierarchy is achieved through the large imagery and headers, movement is given with the red line as you move your eye downwards, and negative space allows moments for the eye to rest.

# Design Abilities
Some unique aspects of this design artifact are that I did wireframes of the concept in Adobe XD and I coded it entirely in HTML/CSS. This design artifact shows that I know how to wireframe, deploy and host a website, code in HTML/CSS, and develop a cohesive web design.

# Potential Improvements
An improvement to this website is making it more responsive. The design does not consider this website on other platforms like phones and tablets. It could also be more interactive for the user. For example, when coming onto a new page, the elements could slowly fade in, or clicking a menu item photo could enlarge it into an overlay. There is plenty to improve with this artifact. These improvements will make a better user experience for visitors.
