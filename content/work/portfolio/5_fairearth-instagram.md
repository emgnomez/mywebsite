# Purpose
The purpose of this design artifact is to show the brand identity for Fairearth. It also shows my ability to create <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fairearth.eco/" style="color: var(--pink);" onmouseover="this.style.color='var(--dark)'" onmouseout="this.style.color='var(--pink)'">social media</a> content for the brand. The audience of this design artifact is people interested in my branding capabilities. The real-world users are consumers and conscious fashion brands. The consumers are people interested in slow fashion and finding clothing brands that align with their values. Fairearth will partner with brands and display them on Fairearth’s platform where these brands will gain more exposure for their values and business practices. This artifact should show how my design fits in a social media setting and give a sense of the brand identity. The brand should communicate Fairearth’s mission, values, personality, and the visual elements such as logo and design patterns.

# Design Rationale
The overall concept for this design artifact is to promote an emerging company on social media and its brand identity. This design meets my audiences’ needs by communicating Fairearth’s goals of garnering attention to the website and having a cohesive brand identity. The mockup shows that the design should be viewed on the mobile Instagram app. I used the principles/elements of negative space, emphasis, and harmony in this design. There is negative space around the social media post and even a dimensional effect to it with the shading underneath it. This makes the post more emphasized, and our eyes draw inwards. The post circles come off the page sides which creates a harmonized effect and connects the post mockup to the surrounding empty space.

# Design Abilities
Unique aspects of this design artifact are that I did a complete branding of Fairearth and used many brand elements in this social media mockup. These elements include brandmark, color (green and gold accents), and leaf/circle visual elements of interest. This design artifact shows that I know how to create a logo, brand identity, social media post, and UX copy.

# Potential Improvements
An improvement to this branding mockup is making more post examples and using a mockup that shows a variety of Fairearth social media posts promoting the brand. There are more engaging mockups that show an account’s profile, grid of posts, and stories. If I create more content, then there would be more material to work with and show how I incorporate the brand outside of a single post. The design could also be expanded to create wireframes and mockups of the website on computer and mobile using the brand guidelines. If I could explore this more, then a UX case study could be conducted to understand the critical functionalities of this emerging platform. I would gather both consumer and brand input on this part since both are necessary for this platform to succeed.
